---------- IDS Specific info -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. $CURRENT_EXP path should be updated from ~/.bashrc: e.g. export CURRENT_EXP=/Data_Dir/2021/IS622/
2. 'grafana_monitor' should be always running in 'screen'. 
	Grafana servers available at: 	http://ids-monitor:3000/ (CERN Network only) and 
					https://ids-status.web.cern.ch/ (accessible everywhere with CERN login) 
3. Always run "poll2" and "monitor_txt" in "tmux". 
- Open tmux session: tmux new -s poll2
	Open vertical pane: Ctrl+A % 
	Open horizontal pane: Ctrl+A " 
	Dettach session: ctrl+A D
	Re-attach session: tmux attach -t poll2
- Both 'poll2' and 'monitor_txt' must be started from ~/poll folder
- Always set raw data folder to $CURRENT_EXP/RAW/ in poll2 using 'fdir'
- poll2 must run in 1.0 pane (indicator at the bottom of the window) for the pixie_control_gui.py to work 

4. Automatic data backup to CERN EOS should be started by root user (su) in 'screen'. 
- Script backup_to_EOS.sh located in /Data_Dir/2021/. Only 'su' has access.
 
5. Simple DAQ Control and e-log: 'pixie_control_gui.py' (script located in /home/pixie/programs/xia4ids/scripts)

6. Sort files using 'xia4ids' in $CURRENT_EXP/ONLINE/. Help here: https://github.com/rlica
- The $CURRENT_EXP/ONLINE/conf folder contains all the necessary configuration files for 
converting data to ROOT or GASPWare
- $CURRENT_EXP/ONLINE/cal folder contains all the calibration files
- 'Autosort' files are used for quasi-automatic sorting of data

Useful commands and tricks for poll2:

fdir /set/your/output/directory/RAW

adjust_offsets -1

thresh 20

toggle 0 4:11 gain   // This changes the gain bit in CHAN_CSRA.

adjust_offsets 0

Traces: 
toggle 0 0 trace
pwrite 0 0 TRACE_DELAY 0.500
pwrite 0 0 TRACE_LENGTH 5.5
timedrun ttk_test_traces
prefix ttk_test_traces // Set output file prefix

timedrun 30 // Set running time and run

pwrite 1 -1 TRIGGER_THRESHOLD 1000

startvme // run without writing to ldf file(?)

save x.set // save current settings to a binary file readable by poll2
dump x.txt // save all settings as a text file 



Robert: For LaBr3 i artificially changed the gain by changing TAU from 0.01 to 0.02.

Scan + damm:
utkscanor xxx -c Config-IDS_RG02.xml 
and then
file run_032.ldf (which is the symlink to one of the random files, which you generated).
The xml file has definition of parameters in pixie modules and callouts to some standard processors.
You can view the spectra using damm:
damm
fig 11
in xxx.his
d 17
(raw spectra are number as follows N=[mod-number]*16+chan_number)
17=1*16+1
Counters are in the N+600 files.
